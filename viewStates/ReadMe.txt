This is a full project created by FlashBuilder using flex 4 SDK beta 2.

When starts, there is an error about can not convert
spark.components::NavigatorContent to mx.core.Container.
But the labels have bean translated already and I didn't find other
problems so far.
Also, another problem is about translation when there are many
states with flex 4 new syntax. You have known it, right?
