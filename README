Sample Applications and Usages for l10n Injection Flex library

Using the l10nInjection.swc, these samples demonstrate real-world usages and the resulting power of IoC and runtime localization injections.

This GIT repository contains the following samples

1) RegistrationDemo - Flex Application compiled with Flex 3.5 SDK
   Demonstrates runtime locale changes to update strings, PNGs, and skins of a RegistrationForm
   
2) viewStates - Flex Application compiled for Flex 4.x
   Demonstrates use of l10nInjection and "advanced" features to support localization injections during view state changes.
