<compiler additionalCompilerArguments="-locale="  kills all compiling and embedding of resource files (including the default locale, I think)
If not embedding the locale resources, you must use ANT to build the external resource bundles.

Should not call init() on creationComplete of Label; instead on creationComplete of Application

Cannot change locale chain until the resource bundle has loaded
Changing locale chain, the current locale should be FIRST in the list
 - injection fails because portuguese is the 2nd locale in the chain.

l10nInjection has ExternalLocaleCommand built-in; so loading external bundles and auto-switching are trivial

Do not need to pass "this" as bindable param to LocalizationMap; use SmartResourceInjector
If you are loading external (not embedded bundles), do not use [ResourceBundle("test")].

DateChooser does not have a "formatString" property; only the DateField combo has this... so injection silently fails.
