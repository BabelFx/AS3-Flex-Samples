### Sample Applications and Usages with BabelFx  (fka l10nInjection framework)

Using the [Framework_BabelFx.swc](https://github.com/BabelFx/AS3-Flex-Library/bin), these samples demonstrate real-world usages and the resulting power of IoC and runtime localization injections.

---

It is strongly recommend that developers 1st download the [BabelFx Library Project](https://github.com/BabelFx/AS3-Flex-Library) and compile the Framework_BabelFx swc with the SDK of their choice (the same SDK that your custom Flex application will also use).
